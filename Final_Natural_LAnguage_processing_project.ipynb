      "Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never\r\n",
      "lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in\r\n",
      "sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly\r\n",
      "meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human\r\n",
      "beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his\r\n",
      "talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner\r\n",
      "face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with\r\n",
      "himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and\r\n",
      "though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty\r\n",
      "years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost\r\n",
      "with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in\r\n",
      "any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. &ldquo;I incline to\r\n",
      "Cain&rsquo;s heresy,&rdquo; he used to say quaintly: &ldquo;I let my brother go\r\n",
      "to the devil in his own way.&rdquo; In this character, it was frequently his\r\n",
      "fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\r\n",
      "the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about\r\n",
      "his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n",

      "No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the\r\n",
      "best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of\r\n",
      "good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle\r\n",
      "ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer&rsquo;s way.\r\n",
      "His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest;\r\n",
      "his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in\r\n",
      "the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield,\r\n",
      "his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for\r\n",
      "many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find\r\n",
      "in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,\r\n",
      "that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious\r\n",
      "relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest\r\n",
      "store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not\r\n",

      "drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it\r\n",
      "seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus\r\n",
      "of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that\r\n",
      "thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even\r\n",
      "on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of\r\n",
      "passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a\r\n",
      "fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses,\r\n",

      "showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead\r\n",
      "of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of\r\n",
      "prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell\r\n",
      "nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and\r\n",
      "struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy\r\n",

      "home from some place at the end of the world, about three o&rsquo;clock of a\r\n",
      "black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\n",
      "literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks\r\n",
      "asleep&mdash;street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all\r\n",
      "as empty as a church&mdash;till at last I got into that state of mind when a\r\n",
      "man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at\r\n",
      "once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a\r\n",
      "good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard\r\n",
      "as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another\r\n",
      "naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing;\r\n",
      "for the man trampled calmly over the child&rsquo;s body and left her screaming\r\n",
      "on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It\r\n",
      "wasn&rsquo;t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few\r\n",
      "halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\r\n",
      "there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly\r\n",
      "cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out\r\n",
      "the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the\r\n",
      "girl&rsquo;s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been\r\n",
      "sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more\r\n",
      "frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would\r\n",
      "be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing\r\n",
      "to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child&rsquo;s family, which was only\r\n",
      "natural. But the doctor&rsquo;s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut\r\n",
      "and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\r\n",
      "accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of\r\n",
      "us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and\r\n",
      "white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew\r\n",
      "what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best.\r\n",
      "We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should\r\n",
      "make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends\r\n",
      "or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we\r\n",
      "were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could\r\n",
      "for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces;\r\n",
      "and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering\r\n",
      "coolness&mdash;frightened too, I could see that&mdash;but carrying it off, sir,\r\n",
      "really like Satan. &lsquo;If you choose to make capital out of this\r\n",
      "accident,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\r\n",
      "wishes to avoid a scene,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Name your figure.&rsquo; Well,\r\n",
      "we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child&rsquo;s family; he would\r\n",
      "have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\r\n",
      "that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the\r\n",
      "money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the\r\n",
      "door?&mdash;whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter\r\n",
      "of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts&rsquo;s, drawn\r\n",
      "payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can&rsquo;t mention, though\r\n",
      "it&rsquo;s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well\r\n",
      "known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for\r\n",
      "more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my\r\n",
      "gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not,\r\n",
      "in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with\r\n",
      "another man&rsquo;s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite\r\n",
      "easy and sneering. &lsquo;Set your mind at rest,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I will\r\n",
      "stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.&rsquo; So we all\r\n",
      "set off, the doctor, and the child&rsquo;s father, and our friend and myself,\r\n",
      "and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\r\n",

      "a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high\r\n",
      "position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant\r\n",
      "living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about\r\n",

      "step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at\r\n",
      "that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next\r\n",
